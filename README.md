# mirobot_ros2
Changed mirobot packages from ROS to ROS2

Original mirobot packages are in: https://github.com/wlkata/RosForMirobot-master

The files are not complete yet!!
All files could build and compile, but I checked that mirobot_urdf_2 doesn't work properly

Any comments or suggestions will be appreciated a lot:) (I'm quite new to ROS!)
